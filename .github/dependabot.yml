# Update strategy:
# - Weekly checks on Mondays at 03:00 UTC
# - Automatic PR creation for security updates
# - Manual review required before merge
# - Limit concurrent PRs to avoid noise
#
# Monitored ecosystems:
# 1. GitHub Actions (workflow dependencies)
# 2. Docker (Alpine base image)
#
# Note: Shell scripts and Tor itself are updated manually
# as they require specific testing and validation.
