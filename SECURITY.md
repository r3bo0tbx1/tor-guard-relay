# Security Policy üîí
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

## Scope

This policy covers the **Tor Guard Relay** Docker image, scripts, and workflows in this repository.  
Issues related to the Tor network itself should be reported directly to [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/).

---

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 1.0      | ‚úÖ | Current stable release |
| < 1.0    | ‚ùå | Pre-release versions |

---

## Security Updates

- Security patches are released as soon as possible after discovery.  
- Critical vulnerabilities are prioritized.  
- Weekly automated builds include the latest Alpine and Tor security updates.  
- Subscribe to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/r3bo0tbx1/tor-guard-relay/releases) for notifications.

### Automated Hardening

To reduce patch-lag risk, GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Pulls the latest Alpine base image.
2. Installs the latest Tor package.
3. Applies security patches.
4. Rebuilds multi-architecture images.
5. Publishes to GHCR.

These rebuilds include Alpine CVE patches and Tor security fixes without changing functionality.

## Security Best Practices

### For Relay Operators

#### Configuration Security
```bash
# Secure your relay.conf file
chmod 600 /path/to/relay.conf
chown root:root /path/to/relay.conf

# Use read-only mounts
-v /path/to/relay.conf:/etc/tor/torrc:ro
````

#### Contact Information

```conf
# Use a dedicated email for relay operations
ContactInfo tor-relay@example.com <0xPGP_FINGERPRINT>

# Optionally include abuse contact
ContactInfo your-email proof:uri-rsa abuse:abuse@example.com
```

#### Network Security

```bash
# Firewall rules (UFW example)
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 9001/tcp  # ORPort
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH (be careful!)
sudo ufw enable

# Regular security updates
apt update && apt upgrade -y   # Ubuntu/Debian
yum update -y                  # RHEL/CentOS
```

#### Monitoring

```bash
# Log monitoring
docker logs guard-relay 2>&1 | grep -iE "(error|warn|critical)"

# Scheduled health checks
0 */6 * * * docker exec guard-relay relay-status >> /var/log/relay-check.log

# Resource monitoring
docker stats guard-relay --no-stream
```

---

### For Contributors

#### Code Security

* Never commit secrets or API keys.
* Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files.
* Review dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* Follow the principle of least privilege.
* Validate all user inputs.

#### Docker Security

```dockerfile
# Always specify explicit base version
FROM alpine:edge  # Pinned dynamically in CI for latest security patches

# Run as non-root user
USER tor

# Use Docker security options
--security-opt no-new-privileges:true
--cap-drop ALL
--cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

#### Secret Management

```bash
# NEVER do this:
git add relay.conf  # Contains sensitive info!

# Instead:
echo "*.conf" >> .gitignore
echo "relay.conf" >> .gitignore
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Host Network Mode

**What:** Container uses `--network host`
**Why:** Enables Tor dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) support

**Security Impact:**

* ‚úÖ Container cannot access other containers
* ‚úÖ Runs as non-root user (`tor`)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Shares host network namespace
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Can bind to any host port

**Mitigations:**

* Drops unnecessary capabilities
* Uses `no-new-privileges:true`
* Only grants required capabilities
* Relies on proper firewall configuration

### Volume Permissions

**What:** Persistent volumes store keys and state.
**Security Impact:** Keys live in `/var/lib/tor`; protect them from unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:**

```bash
# Check volume permissions
docker volume inspect tor-guard-data

# The container automatically sets:
chmod 700 /var/lib/tor
chown tor:tor /var/lib/tor
```

### Configuration Exposure

**What:** Configuration is mounted from the host.
**Impact:** May reveal bandwidth limits, ContactInfo, etc.

**Mitigation:**

* Use read-only mount (`:ro`)
* Set restrictive file permissions (600)
* Never commit configs
* Sanitize before sharing

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

* ‚úÖ Non-root operation (user `tor`)
* ‚úÖ Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
* ‚úÖ Drops unnecessary capabilities
* ‚úÖ Read-only configuration mount
* ‚úÖ Automatic permission healing
* ‚úÖ Configuration validation on startup

### Weekly Security Updates

To ensure ongoing hardening, CI automatically:

1. Pulls latest Alpine base.
2. Installs updated Tor.
3. Applies available patches.
4. Rebuilds and republishes to GHCR.

Enable automatic updates in Cosmos:

```json
"cosmos-auto-update": "true",
"cosmos-auto-update-notify": "true"
```

## Compliance & Legal

### Tor Network Participation

Running a Tor relay is legal in most countries, but:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Check local laws and ISP terms of service.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Understand exit vs. guard relay differences.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep contact information accurate.

**This project runs GUARD relays (not exit relays) by default.**

### Data Handling

* Tor relays do **not** log traffic content.
* Relay fingerprints are public.
* Contact information and bandwidth statistics are public.

### Abuse Handling

If you receive abuse complaints:

1. Verify it‚Äôs actually your relay.
2. Review Tor Project [abuse response templates](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/eff-tor-legal-faq/).
3. Respond professionally.
4. Consider your legal position.
5. Join [tor-relays mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays) for help.
